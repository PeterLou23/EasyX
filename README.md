# EasyX Project

This is a web service that will take the current location of the browswer or if not available take an input of a location by the user. Then it will display your current location with a black marker while the other nearby locations are marked with the iconic Google Map's pin markers. 

On the market page, after entering a valid US zip code a list of local farmer markets are generated. Farmer markets are usually cheaper than the grocery store, and provide fresh and nutritious food for any family at the fraction of the cost. 

The idea that inspired this project is the challenge food desert. The idea is to try to show local food places in a certain radius around your currnet location. 

# Main Page
Please allow the browser to have location access, so it may make the map of your current location. 
If not allowed, you the user will have to enter an address manualy and then it may generate some results, other wise a possible location will be selected and the pins would have no meaning for you. 

# Market Page
Please enter a valid US zipcode into the textbox and either click sumbit or hit enter
The list generated underneath will contain a number and the name of the market. The number is the distance from the middle of the zipcode area.
